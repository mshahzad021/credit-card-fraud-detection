# 🕵️‍♂️ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses transaction data to detect fraudulent credit card activity using SQL and machine learning.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `credit_card_data.csv`: Raw data for exploration
- `credit_card_model_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset for model training
- `fraud_analysis_queries.sql`: SQL queries for data exploration & feature engineering
- `credit_fraud_model.py`: Python code for training fraud detection model
- `Credit Card Fraud Detection Project`: Final project report (PDF)

## 📊 Goal
To build a predictive model that flags fraudulent credit card transactions based on merchant category, location, and user demographics.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Certain merchant categories are fraud-prone
- Some states see more fraud than others
- Age and amount correlate with fraud likelihood

## 🧠 Model Performance
- Precision (Fraud): 0.84
- Recall (Fraud): 0.61
- F1-Score (Fraud): 0.70
- Overall Accuracy: 100%
